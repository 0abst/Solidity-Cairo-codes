# Solidity / Cairo - codes

In this repository, several codes written in Solidity as well as in Cairo are gathered.

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state. (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/)

Cairo is a programming language for writing provable programs, where one party can prove to another that a certain computation was executed correctly. Cairo and similar proof systems can be used to provide scalability to blockchains. (https://starknet.io/docs/index.html)

The aim here was to get more familiar with the technology. These codes have been written in 2021 and 2022.

For Solidity we have:

 * Codes written based on the OpenZeppelin framework
 
 * Read code, compile, deploy and interact with a contract with Javascript. Use of the Truffle (https://trufflesuite.com/) and the Hardhat (https://hardhat.org/) environments
 
 * One of the main tasks has been to solve the challenges here: https://github.com/l-henri/solidity-101
 
For Cairo we have:

 * Codes written based on the OpenZeppelin framework (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts)
 
 * Read code, compile, deploy and interact with a contract with Javascript
 
 * One of the main tasks has been to solve the challenges here: https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-cairo-101
 
 * Work has also been done with the Warp transpiler (https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp). The Warp transpiler converts code from Solidity to Cairo. The aim was to understand to which extent can such a transpiler be used or is it just better to write all codes in Cairo directly?
 
 * Starklings tutorials (https://github.com/onlydustxyz/starklings) have been done to better understand how Cairo works
